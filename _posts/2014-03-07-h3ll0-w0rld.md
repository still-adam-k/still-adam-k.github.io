So, I started a blog. As a New Year resolution. For 2012 I think ... so it took a little while to spin up.

What will be posted here? Damn if I know. I will figure it out on the go. Extreme blogging FTW!

For the moment, it's my private space to publish notes and thoughts about various, dev-related topics. More for reading than writing, but I hope it will have some value for someone out there .. in some time.

Plus, I got out of comfort zone, installed Ruby, get to know Jekyll, and finally have something to do when bored at work.

Take care
Adam
