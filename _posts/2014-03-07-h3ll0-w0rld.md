So, I started a blog. As a New Year resolution. For 2012, I recall. It sure took a little while to spin up.

What will be posted here? Damn if I know. I will figure it out on the go. Extreme blogging in the essence.

For the moment, it's my private space to publish notes and thoughts about dev-related topics. More for me practicing writing than for being read. But, I hope it will have some value for someone out there .. a little amusement, if nothing else.

Plus, I got out of comfort zone, installed Ruby, get to know Jekyll, and finally have something to do when bored at work.

Take care
